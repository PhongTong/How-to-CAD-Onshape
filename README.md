# How to CAD Almost Anything: MIT Summer 2024!
Welcome to How to CAD Almost Anything! Onshape edition. In this repository, you'll find the workshop's slides, recordings and Onshape files.

## Workshop Summary

Ever wondered how are objects from our daily lives designed? How can we generate a computer 3D model of a mug, a bottle of Diet Coke, or a Saturn V rocket? What about designing the blades of a jet-engine? A test dummy? In this fun MIT Summer 2024 workshop, you will learn the skills to design all of these, and much more! 

Split into 8 2-hour long sessions, the first half of each session will be spent learning new Onshape skills, while the second half will see the application of these new skills through in-class activities, with a focus on reverse engineering. In contrast to traditional mechanical design courses, this workshop places greater emphasis on the design process itself, understanding how we can plan and best leverage our available tools to arrive to our desired result. Thus, the sessions are less about following the instructions on an engineering drawing, and more about independent thinking and strategizing, reverse engineering an object into a 3D model. 

_This course is a sibling version of the original ["How to CAD Almost Anything"](https://github.com/andyeske/How-to-CAD-Almost-Anything) course, adapted into 8, 2-hour long sessions. This course is intended for both existing Solidworks users looking to learn a new CAD software, as well as new users trying to learn how to CAD, especially in a truly free, online software)_

### Session 4: Sweeping through a marble run!
(Wednesday, June 26)

**Objective:** In this session, we’ll explore two very powerful Onshape tools, loft and sweep. These tools allow us to create complicated looking geometries, like the body of a 747 or the surface of an apple. Session 4’s goals include: 
* Learning how to use the lofting and sweep command.
* Continuing to master previously explored tools, such as revolve, linear/circular patterns and plane creation.

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 4, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
* A simple [marble run](https://montessorigeneration.com/cdn/shop/files/DTdgH93438cac19b64e6581b705060b865e37i_750x750.jpg?v=1704788664), with [rails](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/kPguktA674w/maxresdefault.jpg)!

### Session 8: It is not engineering without drawings!
(Wednesday, August 14)

**Objective:** In this last session, we’ll exploit one of Onshape’s built-in best features, its drawing-creation workspace. In essence, after creating a part or assembly model, it is possible to create an engineering drawing of it.
Session 8’s goals include:
* Learning how to create an engineering drawing of a part and assembly (including exploded views).
* Exploring the best-practices of drawing creation, including different formats and information to be conveyed (such as tolerancing, material properties).

**Session Activity:** Using the tools learned on Session 8, we’ll design a variety of items, including:
* A laser-cuttable [wooden airplane](https://cdn.create.vista.com/api/media/small/179940816/stock-photo-close-view-small-wooden-toy-plane-white) model.
* A set of engineering drawings of the plane assembly and each of its constituent parts.

**Session Recordings:** To be posted.

**Session Slides:** Available at the [Session 8](https://github.com/andyeske/How-to-CAD-Onshape/tree/main/Session%20Files/Session%208) folder.
